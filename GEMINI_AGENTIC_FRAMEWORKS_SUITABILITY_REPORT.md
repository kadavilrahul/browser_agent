# Agentic Frameworks Suitability Report: crewAI and Agno

This report analyzes the suitability of two agentic frameworks, crewAI and Agno, for the new browser automation tool.

## 1. crewAI

### 1.1. Overview

crewAI is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. It allows developers to build multi-agent systems where AI agents can collaborate to solve complex tasks.

### 1.2. Key Features

*   **Role-Based Agents:** Agents can be assigned specific roles, goals, and tools.
*   **Flexible Tools:** Agents can be equipped with custom tools and APIs to interact with external services.
*   **Intelligent Collaboration:** Agents can work together, share insights, and coordinate tasks.
*   **Task Management:** Supports sequential and parallel task execution.

### 1.3. Suitability for Browser Automation

crewAI is well-suited for building a sophisticated browser automation tool. Its role-based agent system can be used to create specialized agents for different tasks, such as a "navigator" agent for browsing websites, a "scraper" agent for extracting data, and a "tester" agent for running automated tests. The ability to create custom tools would allow for seamless integration with Playwright and other browser automation libraries.

## 2. Agno

### 2.1. Overview

Agno (formerly Phidata) is a full-stack framework for building multi-agent systems with memory, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. It is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing developers to use various large language models (LLMs).

### 2.2. Key Features

*   **Multi-Agent Systems:** Provides an architecture for building teams of collaborating agents.
*   **Memory and Knowledge:** Built-in drivers for storage and memory, giving agents long-term memory and session storage.
*   **Reasoning:** Supports multiple approaches to reasoning, including chain-of-thought.
*   **Multi-modality:** Can handle text, image, audio, and video as input and output.

### 2.3. Suitability for Browser Automation

Agno is also a strong candidate for the new browser automation tool. Its focus on memory and knowledge would be particularly useful for building a tool that can learn from its interactions and improve over time. The multi-modality support would allow for advanced features, such as analyzing images and videos on web pages.

## 3. Comparison and Recommendation

| Feature | crewAI | Agno |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Focus** | Role-playing, autonomous agents | Multi-agent systems with memory and knowledge |
| **Collaboration** | Task-based collaboration | Collaborative problem-solving |
| **Memory** | Basic | Advanced, with long-term memory |
| **Reasoning** | Basic | Advanced, with chain-of-thought |
| **Multi-modality** | Limited | Yes |

Both frameworks are excellent choices for building a modern browser automation tool. However, for the initial version of the new tool, **crewAI** is recommended due to its simpler and more focused approach. Its role-based agent system is a natural fit for the proposed architecture, and its flexible tool system will make it easy to integrate with Playwright.

Agno could be considered for future versions of the tool, as its advanced features, such as long-term memory and multi-modality, would be valuable additions.
