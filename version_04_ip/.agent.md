- Create run.sh file to run the code everytime. 
- Make a comprehensive run.sh which checks all environment and package installations, installs only if not already present,
- The run.sh should run the script with description, interactive user input with serial numbers, complete end to end setup and running without me looking at READMEâ–ˆ. 
- The run.sh should not have verbose, make run.sh minimalistic and test it.
- Don't make any markdown files until I tell you to do so
