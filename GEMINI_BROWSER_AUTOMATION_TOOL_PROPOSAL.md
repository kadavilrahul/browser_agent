# Proposal for a New Browser Automation Tool

This document outlines a proposal for a new browser automation tool, combining the best features from the existing codebase and incorporating new ideas based on modern best practices.

## 1. Core Principles

The new tool will be built on the following principles:

*   **Modularity:** The codebase will be divided into logical modules (e.g., browser management, element interaction, data extraction) to improve maintainability and extensibility.
*   **Reliability:** The tool will be designed to be robust and reliable, with comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.
*   **Ease of Use:** The tool will have a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for both interactive and automated use.
*   **Extensibility:** The tool will be designed to be easily extensible with new features and integrations.

## 2. Proposed Features

The new tool will include the following features:

### 2.1. Browser Management

*   **Lifecycle Management:** Start, stop, and manage the browser lifecycle using Playwright.
*   **Stealth Mode:** Use anti-detection techniques to avoid being blocked by websites.
*   **Session Management:** Save and load browser sessions, including cookies and local storage.

### 2.2. Navigation

*   **Smart Navigation:** Automatically validate and correct URLs, and handle navigation timeouts.
*   **History:** Go back and forward in the browser history.

### 2.3. Element Interaction

*   **Advanced Element Detection:** Use a combination of CSS selectors, XPath, and JavaScript to find clickable elements.
*   **Smart Clicking:** Use multiple fallback strategies for reliable clicking, including coordinates, selectors, and text content.
*   **Form Handling:** Fill out and submit forms.

### 2.4. Data Extraction

*   **Structured Data Extraction:** Extract structured data from pages, such as tables, lists, and JSON-LD.
*   **Content Scraping:** Scrape page content, including text, links, and images.
*   **Exporting:** Export extracted data to various formats, including JSON and CSV.

### 2.5. AI Integration

*   **Natural Language Commands:** Use a language model (e.g., Gemini) to understand and execute natural language commands.
*   **Element Analysis:** Use AI to analyze and suggest the best elements to interact with for a given task.
*   **Page Summarization:** Use AI to generate summaries of web pages.

### 2.6. User Interface

*   **Interactive CLI:** A user-friendly CLI for real-time browser control.
*   **Single Command Mode:** Support for single-command execution for automated tasks.
*   **Web UI (Future):** A web-based interface for non-technical users.

## 3. Architecture

The new tool will have a modular architecture, with the following components:

*   **`main.py`:** The entry point and CLI interface.
*   **`config.py`:** Configuration management.
*   **`browser.py`:** Core browser operations.
*   **`elements.py`:** Element detection and interaction.
*   **`controller.py`:** Interactive control and UI.
*   **`ai.py`:** AI integration.
*   **`data.py`:** Data extraction and exporting.

## 4. Estimated Lines of Code

Based on the existing codebase, the estimated lines of code for the new tool are as follows:

*   **`main.py`:** 150-200 lines
*   **`config.py`:** 100-150 lines
*   **`browser.py`:** 250-300 lines
*   **`elements.py`:** 300-400 lines
*   **`controller.py`:** 200-250 lines
*   **`ai.py`:** 200-300 lines
*   **`data.py`:** 150-200 lines

**Total:** 1350-1800 lines

## 5. Next Steps

1.  **Finalize the architecture and design.**
2.  **Implement the core modules.**
3.  **Develop the CLI and interactive mode.**
4.  **Integrate the AI features.**
5.  **Write comprehensive tests.**
6.  **Create user documentation.**
